        Best NBA Players By Their Generation

    There has been an overall debate for years about who the greatest NBA basketball players of all time are. There are players with a wide variety of backgrounds and stories. There are players from older generations who absolutely dominated their league, and there are players in current time that have made a name for themselves as well. The overall thought that comes to mind when thinking about the GOAT of the NBA is either Lebron James or Michael Jordan.

    These two unique basketball players played in two different generations. They did not compete against the same players and never competed against each other in the NBA. This makes it really hard to compare the two players and decide who is better. When looking at the win column, Michael Jordan would be considered better. When looking at the scoring record, Lebron James takes the throne. Lebron James has played many more years than Michael Jordan, but who is really better?

    I have gone through and done research on the past 30 years of the NBA and determined the best players from each decade including the 1990’s, 2000’s and 2010’s. Each player holds a great reputation in the NBA and has been considered to be the GOAT in some type of way. Based on statistics and overall opinions, each player has been named the GOAT of their decade.

    Below is a list of players from each generation that were considered in the conversation to be the best player of their generation. Take a look at the honorable mentions and players who were recognized for their talents, but weren't quite as good as the player at number 1. These opinions are based on scoring, playmaking, defense, mindset, ability to win games, and who had the greatest overall impact on the NBA itself.
