        Kobe Bryant is most known for his “mamba mentality” and ability to hit a mid range shot like no other. When you shoot a piece of balled up paper into a recycling bin, what do you say? “KOBE!”. This just shows you how often his jump shot went through the net. Kobe Bryant is debatably the greatest mid range shooter of all time. Kobe never backed down and fought through diversity in order to be as successful as he was.
